# Pants, Fire, Anvil
 Unity Tile-Based Strategy Game
 
## What the Heck is this game?
Pants, Fire, Anvil is a parody of Rock, Paper, Scissors, except all of the chance has been removed. Both sides have EVERYTHING in play at once and it's up to you to outmaneuveur your opponent and take the match. 
 
## How do I play?
This build of the game features two (2) gamemodes; Singleplayer and  2P Multiplayer. In both gamemodes, the player(s) control Pants, Fire, and Anvil. Pants moves first, followed by Fire, then Anvil, before repeating the cycle. Pants wants to cover the opponents anvil, Fire wants to roast the opponents pants, and Anvil wants to crush the opponents fire. Remember, your opponent can do the same to you, so be careful to not get covered/roasted/crushed yourself. A piece is removed from play when it shares the same tile as the piece that would eliminate it. The match is over once one side has 0 pieces in play or a tie is reached where neither player can eliminate the other (as in only Pants remain for both teams). Currently there is a way to stall infinitely, so we'll just have to go by the honor system that you won't filibuster your opponent into surrendering.
```
Tip: the AI in Singleplayer mode is pretty dumb so they may accidentally eliminate themselves trying to reach their target

## But seriously, how do I open the game?
Download the repository and run the "Pants, Fire, Anvil.exe" executable within the "Pants, Fire, Anvil Alpha 2.0" folder.

## Singleplayer
You compete against an AI in a preset arrangement of positions. Currently there is only this one "level", but I plan to add more levels and new game mechanics for more puzzling fun.

## Multiplayer
Compete against your friend in this HotSeat Multiplayer! Both players have equal starting positions, but BLU team goes first.
